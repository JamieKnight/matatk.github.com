As some of you may be aware, [AudioQuake and the Level Description Language](http://agrip.org.uk/) have had a turbulent history.  We're very proud of what they've achieved and stand for, and continue to be in awe of the support we've had from the community, but some serious and unexpected life events got in the way of our continued involvement.  However, people are still using them and now I have a little more time, I would like to support that.  I'm currently in the process of dusting them off and getting them going on modern Mac and Windows systems, with easier installation and usage.

It's still early days, but here are a few things that I have been and will be working on...

 * A graphical launcher.
 * An application bundle for the Mac (no install needed).
 * A simpler installer with fewer dependencies for Windows.
 * A GUI for the Level Description Language toolchain.
 * Corresponding documentation and website updates.

Currently I'm concentrating on the Mac side of things and have an experimental build hosted on Dropbox.  You can find out more on [the project's site](http://agrip.org.uk) and if you have comments, please post on [our Google group](https://groups.google.com/group/agrip-project).

Development has [moved to GitHub](https://github.com/matatk/agrip) where you can get and fork the code and file issues, so please do join in the continued development effort.
